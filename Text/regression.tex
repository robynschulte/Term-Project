%% Regression model description:



The regression model predicts age difference as follows 
For every approval by DrLoganLevkoff, age difference is expected 
to rise by NA. 
If the couple is approved by DrPepperSchwartz, age difference are expected 
to be NA higher. 
If there was a successful couple approved by Dr Pepper Schwartz, age difference is expected 
to be -0.667 lower. 
Overall, this model provides a fairly good description with an $R^2$ of -0.044.
